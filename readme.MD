# Rust JSON Serializer

This Rust project is a simple implementation of JSON serialization. It creates a structured representation of an article, which includes an article title, author, and a collection of paragraphs. The application then transforms, or "serializes", this data into JSON format.

When run,```cargo run``` the program generates a JSON string that captures all the details of the article. The JSON string is outputted to the console, providing a readable representation of the article data in JSON format.
